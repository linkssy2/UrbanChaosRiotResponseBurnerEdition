# Burner Edition: current runtime

The current candidate uses the pinned XboxXBERecomp runtime in
`build/upstream-review-xboxxbe-20261014`. The earlier `src/` runtime remains for
historical builds; it is not the current D3D12 executable.

## Where to edit

| Area | Maintained source |
| --- | --- |
| Build and verification order | `scripts/build_xbe_game_trial.py` |
| Original function hooks and dependency overlays | `scripts/prepare_xbe_*.py` |
| PC menu drawing | `scripts/xbe_trial_graphics_ui.cpp`, `xbe_menu_style.h` |
| Menu state and original callbacks | `scripts/xbe_trial_guest_input.cpp`, `xbe_frontend_guest.inc` |
| Rebinding | `scripts/xbe_controls_*.inc`, `xbe_controls.h` |
| Languages | `scripts/xbe_language.cpp`, `xbe_language_ui.inc` |
| Prompt classification and renderer handoff | `scripts/prepare_xbe_pc_prompts.py`, `prepare_xbe_prompt_handoff.py` |
| Quiet release policy | `scripts/prepare_xbe_release.py` |
| Installed game admission | `scripts/prepare_xbe_release_assets.py` |
| ISO import, Setup and direct Play entry points | `launcher/burner-xbe/` |

Generated files under `build/xbe-full-integration-20261014` are private outputs.
Change a maintained source or preparation script, not just its generated copy.
Preparers pin the original bytes or expected source shape so incompatible updates
fail before they can silently apply the wrong patch. Keep the upstream pin until
its replacements pass the same checks.

## Important boundaries

- `gpu::State` additions must be inside the ranges copied by the render queue.
  The prompt handoff regression executes the real transport and an old-layout
  negative witness; a direct renderer test alone misses that failure.
- Language changes select an existing original bank at the next startup. Do not
  switch loaded banks in place or change the video region to choose a language.
  Original strings use CP1252; only host UI copies are converted to UTF-8.
- Release disables routine logging, captures and diagnostic timing at compile
  time. Fatal errors can still reach the launcher's bounded failure report.
  Keep frame pacing, shader caching and normal FPS display independent of tracing.
- Setup verifies imported files locally. The release runtime only accepts its
  explicit extracted directory and the supported executable hashes. Never add a
  permissive fallback or package a developer `assets` directory.
- New runtime settings and `hdd` saves live under the user's `xbe-runtime`
  directory. Updating the executable must not replace those files. The older
  runtime's saves are separate and must not be silently converted or deleted.

## Build and package

Close the game first. Run the existing heavy-build wrapper with
`UCRR_XBE_RELEASE=1` and `scripts/build_xbe_game_trial.py`; clear that environment
setting afterward. This stages the overlays, builds the optimized executable,
and runs the production-contract fixtures. The build report and private symbols
remain beside the build, never in the release ZIP.

Use `launcher/burner-xbe/package.py` with the exact verified runtime SHA256 and a
fresh output directory, compile both launchers with its `build.ps1`, then run the
package audit and `test_setup.py --package`. Its explicit allowlist excludes game
assets, saves, caches and diagnostics. Never archive the workspace as a release.

Offline tests prove their stated contracts, not a full campaign playthrough.
Keep live menu, language/audio, gameplay and performance acceptance separate in
the candidate's verification notes.
